        When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me<br>
        Speaking words of wisdom, let it be<br>
        And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me<br>
        Speaking words of wisdom, let it be<br><br>
        Let it be, let it be<br>
        Let it be, let it be<br>
        Whisper words of wisdom<br>
        Let it be<br><br>
        And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree<br>
        There will be an answer, let it be<br>
        For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see<br>
        There will be an answer, let it be<br><br>
        Let it be, let it be<br>
        Let it be, let it be<br>
        Yeah, there will be an answer<br>
        Let it be<br><br>
        Let it be, let it be<br>
        Let it be, let it be<br>
        Whisper words of wisdom<br>
        Let it be<br>
        Let it be, let it be<br>
        Let it be, yeah, let it be<br>
        Whisper words of wisdom<br>
        Let it be<br><br>
        And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me<br>
        Shine until tomorrow, let it be<br>
        I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me<br>
        Speaking words of wisdom, let it be<br><br>
        Let it be, let it be<br>
        Let it be, yeah, let it be<br>
        There will be an answer<br>

       Hey Jude, don't make it bad<br>
        Take a sad song and make it better<br>
        Remember to let her into your heart<br>
        Then you can start to make it better<br><br>
        Hey Jude, don't be afraid<br>
        You were made to go out and get her<br>
        The minute you let her under your skin<br>
        Then you begin to make it better<br><br>
        Oh-oh-oh, and anytime you feel the pain<br>
        Hey Jude, refrain<br>
        Don't carry the world upon your shoulders<br>
        For well you know that it's a fool<br>
        Who plays it cool<br>
        By making his world a little colder<br><br>
        Hey Jude, don't let me down<br>
        She has found you, now go and get her<br>
        Remember to let her into your heart<br>
        Then you can start to make it better<br>
        Better, better, better<br><br>
        So let it out and let it in<br>
        Hey Jude, begin<br>
        You're waiting for someone to perform with<br>
        And don't you know that it's just you<br>
        Hey Jude, you'll do<br>
        The movement you need is on your shoulder<br>
        La, la, la, la, la<br>
        La, la, la, la, mm<br><br>
        Hey Jude, don't make it bad<br>
        Take a sad song and make it better<br>
        The minute you let her into your heart<br>
        Then you can start to make it better<br>
        Better, better, better, better, better, whoa, yeah!<br>

       The long and winding road<br>
        That leads to your door<br>
        Will never disappear<br>
        I've seen that road before<br>
        It always leads me here<br>
        Lead me to your door<br><br>
        The wild and windy night<br>
        That the rain washed away<br>
        Has left a pool of tears<br>
        Crying for the day<br>
        Why leave me standing here?<br>
        Let me know the way<br><br>
        Many times, I've been alone<br>
        And many times, I've cried<br>
        Anyway, you'll never know<br>
        The many ways I've tried<br><br>
        But still, they lead me back<br>
        To the long winding road<br>
        You left me standing here<br>
        A long, long time ago<br>
        Don't leave me waiting here<br>
        Lead me to your door<br><br>
        But still they lead me back<br>
        To the long winding road<br>
        You left me standing here<br>
        A long, long time ago<br>
        Don't keep me waiting here<br>
        Lead me to your door<br>
        Lead me to your door<br>
